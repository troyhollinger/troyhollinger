	<p>Born in Southern California 1981,
 Troy Hollinger grew up in the
 San Diego suburbs of East County.
 He spent a few primitive years in
 Breckenridge, Colorado as well as
 Brooklyn, New York - San Diego is home.
 Marrying his teenage sweetheart in 2004
 they have 4 children together.</p>
	<br>
	<p>TROY is a self taught designer
 who spent the first decade of his occupation
 life building custom homes.
 The building of large physical structures
 has brought an unique, hands-on understanding
 of things like symmetry, balance, order,
 good lines and durability; all of which
 are evident attributes in TROY’s design practice.<br>
 <span class="quotes">“I like things minimal, simplistic,
 functional, effective and great at interaction.”</span></p>
	<br>
	<p>Design started for TROY when he was 8
 during a class project where he had to draw,
 color and cut out clothing pieces.
 He later launched a t-shirt brand &amp; product line
 with nationwide distribution,
 which acted as a formative medium
 for finding his personal perspective as a designer.</p>
 	<br>
 	<p class="quotes">“The pursuit of improving things
has been a part of me since I can remember.
I love systematic order, everything has a 
place and I want to find it.”</p>
